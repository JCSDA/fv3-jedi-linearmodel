# Linearized forecast model for FV3-JEDI

The Linearized version (tangent linear and adjoint) of the FV3 dynamical core and GEOS model physics. The scientific parts of this system were built by NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office. The infrastructure parts by the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation, UCAR.

This is not a standalone system and is designed to be built with [FV3-JEDI](https://github.com/JCSDA/fv3-jedi).
